  <h1>Hurray, This is UndeadLand</h1>
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>
  In the words of Indigo Mantoya, "let me explain, no there is too much, let me summarize."<br />
  UndeadLand is an <b>Open Source</b>, Procedurally Generated, <span style="color:red">Zombie Survival</span> First-Person Game.<br />
  The goal is to use modern graphic techniques to make a completely procedural world, complete with cities, survivors, and more!<br />
  Right now, it is still being heavily developed, and this repo is mostly for me to have a backup of my dev sources right now, and is not even remotely in a playable state.
  Once it is, however, I'll let you all know.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How do I build it?</h2>
  <p>
  Check out the <a href="compiling.readme">compiling.readme</a> file.
  It's fairly straight forward, but may require a bit of work on your part.
  If you're not familiar with how to build C++ applications, then I'd recommend not bothering with this until there are some regular alpha/beta releases.
  I don't have a time-frame for that yet, sadly.
  </p>
  <h2>Can I contribute?</h2>
  <h3>Contributing Source</h3>
  <p>
  Well, yes and no.  Right now, I'm still hammering out a lot of the roadmap, so I'm going to discourage people volunteering until I have more code foundation.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Contributing Money</h3>
  <p>
  Sure, you can donate some funds to a poor programmer like me!
  PayPal is probably the easiest route.
  Feel free to donate towards buying me energy drinks and flowers for my to apologize for not going to bed at the same time as her.
  If you donate, you'll be added to the credits of the game, and you'll optionally get notified about the status of the game.
